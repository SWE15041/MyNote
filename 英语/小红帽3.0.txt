旁白 小红帽 祖母 兔子A 兔子B 母亲 狼 猎人

旁白：			Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near a big forest.
			Her grandma had made her a beautiful red cloak with a big red hood, which she wore every time she went outside.
			And so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.

- 家
旁白：			One morning, the mother and Little Red Riding Hood were having breakfast at the table.
母：			Grandma isn't feeling very well. 
			Will you take this basket of food through the forest to her cottage？
小红帽：		Yes mother, I sure would love to see Grandma.
母：			I heard that a big bad wolf came near the village recently. Attention on the road.
小红帽：		I will, mother.

- 门口
母:			Remember, don't take to any strangers alone the way!
小红帽：		I won't. Goodbye mother.
小红帽出发
母：			Goodbye.

小红帽边走边采路边的花
小红帽：		Wow! Flowers, how beautiful! One flower, two flowers, three flowers.

狼在树林中
狼：			I am wolf. I am hungry. Here is a little red riding hood! I'm gonna eat her to fill my stomach.

- 狼正准备从树林中蹦出来，看到猎人这时候走过来，狼藏起来
小红帽： 		Hello, Uncle Hunter. how are you?
猎人:			Hello, Little Red Riding Hood. I'm on patrol.
猎人：			Recently, Some villagers saw the big bad Wolf coming to our village. I am protecting the safety of the villagers. Where are you going?
小红帽： 		I'm going to my grandma's cottage on the other side of the forest.
			She isn't feeling well, and I'm bringing her this basket of food and these flowers.
猎人: 			What a sweet girl you are. 
小红帽：   		I had better be going. Goodbye.
猎人：			Goodbye, Be careful.
猎人离开，小红帽继续往外婆家走去
狼思索：		I need to get to Grandma's cottage before Red Riding Hood does. I can eat Grandma first, and then eat the Little Red Riding Hood

- 外婆家
旁白：			As quick as he could, he ran through the forest, all the way to Grandma's cottage.
狼敲门， 外婆躺床上
外婆：			Who is it?
狼：			It's me. Little Red Riding Hood.
外婆：			Come in, come in. The door is unlocked. My baby granddaughter.
狼开门进房子，关上门
外婆：			Oh! Who are you? You're not my granddaughter！
狼：			Grandma, I'll eat you!
外婆： 			Oh, No!
狼吃掉外婆，躺在床上
狼：			I already ate grandma. I'm waiting for Little Red Riding Hood.

一会儿后，小红帽来到了房门前，敲门
狼：			Who is it?
小红帽：		It's me. Little Red Riding Hood. Your granddaughter.
狼：			Come in, come in. The door is unlocked. My baby granddaughter.
小红帽进了房间
